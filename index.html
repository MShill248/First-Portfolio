            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I'm Mohamed, a determined and curious learner on my journey to becoming a DevOps engineer. I'm currently enrolled in a nine-week intensive training program with La Fosse, where I'm building my skills in cloud, automation, and infrastructure. Once completed, I’ll be joining Leidos for my placement. I enjoy working with technology, solving real-world problems, and constantly learning new things. Even without prior experience, I’m fully committed to growing in this field and becoming someone who can make a real impact in any team I join.</p>
